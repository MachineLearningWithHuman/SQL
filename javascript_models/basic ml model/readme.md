<h1>Javascript Tensorflow Model</h1>
<li>Download the initial template for an html file basic.html</li>
<li>We will now add Javascript code into our page</li>
<li> We don't want our model to block the page while on training so we are going to use the
asyncronise method to call when done</li>
<li>add scriptlanguage first </li>
<li>As said let's define the training function into the script</li>
<li>then we will define the model </li>
<li>then we will use an alert to call the result when its done</li>
<h2>Congratulations Your Javascript ML model</h2>
